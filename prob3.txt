Problem Statement 3 :
Account(Acc_no, branch_name,balance) branch(branch_name,branch_city,assets)
customer(cust_name,cust_street,cust_city) Depositor(cust_name,acc_no)
Loan(loan_no,branch_name,amount)
Borrower(cust_name,loan_no)
Solve following query:
Create above tables with appropriate constraints like primary key, foreign key, check constrains, not
null etc
Q1. Find the branches where average account balance > 12000.
Q2. Find number of tuples in customer relation.
Q3. Calculate total loan amount given by bank.
Q4. Delete all loans with loan amount between 1300 and 1500.
Q5. Delete all tuples at every branch located in Nigdi.
Solution :
Create tables as above
Q1. Find the branches where the average account balance is greater than 12,000.
SELECT branch_name
FROM Account
GROUP BY branch_name
HAVING AVG(balance) > 12000;
Q2. Find the number of tuples in the customer relation.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_tuples
FROM customer;
Q3. Calculate the total loan amount given by the bank.
SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_loan_amount
FROM Loan;
Q4. Delete all loans with a loan amount between 1300 and 1500.
DELETE FROM Loan
WHERE amount BETWEEN 1300 AND 1500;
Q5. Delete all tuples at every branch located in Nigdi.
DELETE FROM branch
WHERE branch_city = 'Nigdi';
